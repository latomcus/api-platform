# api-platform
    API Platform is a web framework fo easily create and maintain API-first projects with flexibility and quick turn around.
    * Small code base
    * Standardized JSON response makes it easy to prototype and build web applications
    * Secure POST communications
    * Configurable caching with support for sliding and absolute expiration
    * Use of service style approach in MS SQL Server stored procedures, i.e. JSON in, JSON out
    * Use of server-less style functions to extend functionality, see /lib/functions.js
    * Supports multiple actions, like send email, add or remove cookies, add to cache, remove from cache. More actions can be easily added
    * Mobile friendly GUI web interface that serves as testing tool and documentation

## Getting Started
    Once downloaded, make sure you've configured your database and email server. All settings are in ./config.js

## Prerequisites
    * Node.js (v12 or higher) - https://nodejs.org
    * Localy installed Microsoft SQL Server 2017 (2017 or higher) - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017-editions
    (or connectivity to existing sql server instance)
    * Download repository and open ./sql/sql_server.sql in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, execute the script and make sure there are no errors

## Configuration
    All configurations are in ./config.js file
    * email: tested with Gmail service. Please see steps involved to get app password: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en
    * mssql: update your sql server credentials and settins as needed:

    ```
    user: "api_user",
    password: "secret",
    server: "COMPUTER2\\SQLEXPRESS",
    database: "api_database"
    ```

## Installing
    $ git clone https://github.com/latomcus/api-platform/api-platform.git
    $ npm start
    Open in browser: http://localhost:3000

## Data Format
    Outgoing JSON data is structured as follows:
    * code - {required} system wide unique value that easily identifies the source, or module, or condition in your code.
    Code format: [origin].[function].[condition]
    Example: 'd.aa.02' refers to database
    Codes are organized as follows:
    s.* - generated by app.js module
    f.* - generated by functions.js module
    d.* - generated by database

    * message - {required} readable text describing action performed
    * data - [optional] any additional data, could be collection of rows and columns, or text needed to compose web page or for any client application consuming the data
    * actions - [optional] one or multiple actions needed to be performed by the server such as setting up cookie, sending email(s), writting to a file, etc.

## Web Interface
    ./public/index.html is static page that uses static ./js/api.js to load APIs, documentation, and sample data.
    Note for ./js/api.js: styles for api[x].style could be one of the following: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark, link (as described in https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/buttons/)
