# REST API Platform (alpha)
API Platform is a web framework to easily create and maintain API-first projects. Suitable for small to medium sized projects with fluid requirements.
* Performance: using multi-CPUs and shared in-memory cache
* Standard: consistent input/output JSON format makes it easy to prototype and build client applications
* Secure: all POST communications (use SSL in production); CORS enabled

### Features
* Configurable caching with support for _sliding_ and _absolute_ expiration
* Use of _service style_ approach for all database code, i.e. JSON in, JSON out
* Use of server functions to extend functionality, see **/lib/functions.js**
* Supports multiple actions: send email & SMS, add/remove cookies, add/remove cache. Add your own actions as needed
* Mobile friendly GUI web interface that serves as a testing tool and documentation
* Supported databases: Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Getting Started
Once downloaded, make sure you've configured your database and email server. All settings are in **./config.js** file.

### Prerequisites
* Node
* Connectivity to instances of Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL databases
* Download repository, open **./sql/[your choice of database].sql**, and execute SQL code to create all database dependencies.

### Configuration
All configurations are in **./config.js** file
 * `email`: tested with Gmail service. Steps to get your app password: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833
    ```
    service: 'Gmail',
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com',
    password: 'app-secret-key'
    ```
 * `data_source`: Options: "mssql" or "postgres" or "mysql". Update configuration for a database of your choice.

### Installing
    $ git clone https://github.com/latomcus/api-platform.git
    $ cd api-platform
    $ npm install
    $ npm run start
Open in browser: http://localhost:3000  

#### If _config.cache.autostart_: **false**, then start cache as a separate process:  
    $ npm run cache  
To test cache: http://localhost:3001/ping

### Data Format
Outgoing JSON data is structured as follows:
 * `code` - {required} system wide unique value that easily identifies the source, or module, or condition in your code.
Code format: [origin].[function].[condition]
Example: 'd.aa.02' refers to database.
Codes are organized as follows:
   - f.* - generated by **/lib/functions.js** module
   - d.* - generated by SQL database
   - w.* - generated by **/worker.js** module

 * `message` - {required} readable text describing performed action
 * `data` - [optional] any additional data, could be collection of rows and columns, or structured text needed to compose web page or any valid JSON formatted data
 * `actions` - [optional] one or multiple actions needed to be performed by the server such as setting up cookie, sending email(s), writing to a file, etc.

### Web Interface
**./public/index.html** is static page that uses static **./js/api.js** to load APIs, documentation, and sample data.
Note for **./js/api.js**: styles for _api.style_ could be one of the following: _primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark, link_
